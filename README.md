# impact_foundering
Model, dependencies, and figures for "Surface-to-ocean exchange by the sinking of impact generated melt chambers on Europa" published in Geophysical Research Letters. 

The main numerical model is in model_and_dependencies/impactorTempMeltFunc.m and the wrapper to run the numerical model is model_and_dependencies/wrapper_impactorTempMeltFunc.m

Initial conditions, i.e., digitized outputs from ISale impact simulations of Cox and Bauer, 2015 are in initial_conditions/ and are names based on the keys used in Cox and Bauer, 2015. 

Code to recreat the figures in the study are in figures/ and are named based on the figure in the paper.
